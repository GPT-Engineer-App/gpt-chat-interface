# gpt-chat-interface

I need a web chat interface that is like a ChatGPT clone. The chat is a wss stream.

<link href="https://cdn.revmo.ai/chat/chatbot.css" rel="stylesheet"/>

<script src="https://app.yourfri.day/chatjs/ZmUyNjljNTQtNzlkNS0xMWVlLWE3YTgtMGE1OGE5ZmVhYzAy/"></script>   The CSS is for reference and should be adapted to match our ChatGPT clone interface. The font should be Poppins everywhere and the main colors are #00061a for the background and for text ##fcfbe7 and slight highlights #b45f06
